# adventureworks-sales-sql-analysis

## Overview
This project uses SQL to analyze AdventureWorks sales data in order to evaluate overall business performance, identify key growth drivers, and uncover operational inefficiencies.

## Business Questions
- How are sales, revenue, and average order value trending over time?
- Which products and categories contribute most to profit?
- What drives month-over-month revenue growth?
- How does performance vary across territories?
- Are there customer behaviors that indicate inefficiencies or upsell opportunities?

## Analysis Scope
- Baseline KPIs (orders, revenue, AOV)
- Product profitability analysis
- Category-level performance
- Month-over-month revenue growth
- Growth contribution by product and category
- Territory performance (revenue and profit)
- High-frequency, low-revenue customer segmentation

## Data Limitations
The AdventureWorks dataset does not include repeat customer behavior. Therefpore, customer analysis focuses on order efficiency rather than retention metrics.

## Tools
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (CTEs, window functions, aggregations)
